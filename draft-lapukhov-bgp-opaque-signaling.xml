        Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP) enables the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually any information. This document proposes a new Address Family/Subsequent Address Family to be used for distribution of opaque data. This functionality is intended to be used by applications other than BGP for exchange of their own data on top of BGP mesh. The structure of such data SHOULD NOT be interpreted by the regular BGP speakers, rather the goal is to use BGP purely as a convenient and scalable  communication system.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro" toc="default">
      <t>
        Implementation of <xref target="RFC4760">Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4</xref> gives the ability to pass arbitrary data in BGP protocol messages. This capability has been leveraged by many for dissemination of non-routing related information over BGP (e.g. <xref target="RFC5575">"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules"</xref> as well as <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution">"North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using BGP"</xref>). However, there has been no channel defined explicitly to disseminate data with arbitrary payload. The intended use case is for applications other than BGP to leverage the protocol machinery for distribution (broadcasting) of their own state in the network domain. Publishers and consumers will use BGP UPDATE messages to submit and receive opaque data. It is up to the BGP implementation to provide a custom API for message producers or consumers if needed. 
      </t>
      <t>
        One application of this extension could be auto-discovery of various  services in the data-center network that uses BGP as the routing protocol  of choice (<xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-routing-large-dc"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        Another application is building and testing new routing protocols or BGP extensions within existing BGP implementation. The new protocol/extension may influence routing either by directly communicating to the RIB/FIB of the router it runs on, or by overriding BGP paths via BGP route injection. An example of such BGP extension could be <xref target="WISER"/>

    <section title="BGP Opaque Data AFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new AFI known as a "BGP Opaque Data AFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA. The purpose  of this AFI is to exchange opaque information within a BGP  network.
      </t>

    <section title="BGP Key-Value SAFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new SAFI known as "BGP Key-Value  SAFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA. The purpose  of this SAFI is exchange of opaque information structured as a  Key-Value binding.
      </t>

    <section title="BGP Key-Value VPN SAFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new SAFI known as a "BGP Key-Value VPN  SAFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA. The purpose of  this SAFI is exchange of opaque information structured as a Key-Value binding over service provider backbone providing Virtual Private Networks as a service.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC4364"/> defines a method and procedures for implementing VPNs using  BGP as a control plane. All the procedures of <xref target="RFC4364"/> applies to  the BGP Key-Value VPN SAFI. To facilitate the support for VPNs, the NLRI for the opaque information has 8 bytes of Route Distinguisher at the beginning of the NLRI field.
      </t>
    </section>    
    <section title="Capability Advertisement" toc="default">
      <t>
        A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange Opaque Data MUST use the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code, as defined in <xref  target="RFC4760"/>, to advertise the corresponding AFI/SAFI  pair.
      </t>
    </section>    
    <section title="Disseminating Key-Value bindings" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document proposes to implement a distributed, eventually consistent Key-Value store on top of existing BGP protocol mechanics. The "Key" portion is to be encoded as the NLRI part of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute and "Value" encoded using a new optional transitive attribute. 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Publishers, acting as BGP speakers, advertise keys along with associated values into the routing domain. The BGP  network synchronizes that state by propagating the encoded  data following regular BGP protocol operations. 
          </t>
          <t>
            Consumers, acting as BGP speakers, receive the information via BGP protocol UPDATE messages. Only publishers and  consumers of the opaque data are supposed to interpret its  contents - the rest of the BGP network acts merely as a  dissemination system. 
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Multiple publishers can advertise the same key (NLRI) bound to different values. It is also possible for the advertised binding to have the same Key-Value pairs but differ in some other BGP attributes. In that case, BGP would follow the best-path selection logic to prevent duplicate information in the network. A consumer will receive the value created by the publisher "closest" in terms of BGP best-path selection logic, based on the policies that exist in the routing domain. This document does not propose any method of achieving global consensus for all published values for a given key. 
      </t>  
      <section title="Publishing a Key-Value binding" toc="default">
        <t>
          The encoding scheme proposed below follows the semantics of a Key-Value bindings. The "Key" is stored in the NLRI section of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute, as shown on <xref target="mp_reach_nlri"/>.

              AS Number: Four octets encoding the AS Number of an Autonomous System originating the key-value binding. If set to non-zero, the receiving BGP speaker SHOULD validate this field for correctness, e.g. making sure it does not carry reserved AS number values. In case of format violation, the receiving speaker SHOULD ignore the attribute and MAY log this event.

            <t>
              Originator ID: 16 Octets encoding the Originator ID value. If set to non-zero, the Originator ID SHOULD be interpreted an IPv6 address of a node originating the NLRI. In case if the sending node does not have an IPv6 addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address SHOULD be used. If set to non-zero, the receiving BGP speaker SHOULD validate the field to be a syntactically valid IPv6 or IPv4 unicast address. In case of format violation, the receiving speaker SHOULD ignore the attribute value and MAY log this event.

            <t>
              Opaque Value Length: Two octets encoding the total length of the attribute in octets, including the Type and Length fields. The length is encoded as an unsigned binary  integer. The four most significant bits of this field MUST  be set to zero, due to the limit imposed by maximum BGP  message size. Note that the minimum length is "3", indicating that no Opaque Value Data field is present. Such binding, in presence of non-zero length key is still  valid, as it informs the consumers that the key "exists".

          Even when the OPAQUE_VALUE attribute is not present in BGP advertisement, the BGP implementation MUST still retain Opaque Key (NLRI) in its LocRIB and propagate it  further as usual. This case is to be interpreted as an announcement of the key existence.

           It is possible to propagate multiple values associated with  the same key using the Add-Path extension defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths" />.

        Limiting the scope of opaque information flooding is an important operational concern. BGP already has the mechanisms  needed to control this process, and these mechanisms are briefly  reviewed below.

      <section title="Automated filtering">
        <t>
          One can leverage mechanics presented in <xref target="RFC4684"/> and use the route-target extended  community attribute to identify "channels" where key-value  bindings are published. The consumers would signal their  interest in particular "channel" by advertising the  corresponding router-target membership. The publications then  need to contain the router-target extended community attribute  to constrain information propagation.

      <section title="Filtering via policy">
        <t>
          Ad-doc message filtering could be implemented using BGP  standard (see <xref target="RFC4271"/>) or extended community  attributes (see <xref target="RFC4360"/>). The semantic of  these attributes is to determined by the policy and  publishers/consumers. Filtering could be done locally on  receiving speaker, or on remote speaker, by using outbound  route filtering feature defined in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.
